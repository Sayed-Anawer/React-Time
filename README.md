# React from Scratch

Here many basic things are noted.

## 1. What is crossorigin (CORS)

The crossorigin attribute is used in HTML (mainly in <script>, <img>, and <link> elements) to handle cross-origin requests. It controls how browsers handle requests for resources from different origins (domains, protocols, or ports).
## Values of crossorigin

| ``` Value ```            | ``` Description  ```                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| anonymous | Requests the resource without credentials (cookies, HTTP authentication, etc.). |
| use-credentials | Requests the resource with credentials (cookies, authentication, etc.). |
| (empty) | Behaves like anonymous by default.|

## 2. ðŸ“¦ package.json vs. package-lock.json â€“ Key Differences

| ``` Feature ```            | ``` package.json ```        | ``` package-lock.json ```|
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Purpose | Defines project dependencies, metadata, and scripts. | Locks exact versions of installed dependencies. |
| Contains | List of dependencies with version ranges (^ or ~). | Exact versions of dependencies & sub-dependencies.|
| Versioning | Allows flexible versioning (e.g., ^1.2.3). | Stores the exact installed version (e.g., 1.2.4). |
| Needed in Git?  | Yes, required to install dependencies. | Yes, for consistency across environments. |
| Editable by Hand?	| Yes, you can modify dependencies manually. | No, its auto-generated by npm install.|

#### ðŸŽ¯ Main Difference
- ``` package.json ``` declares what your project needs.
- ``` package-lock.json ``` ensures everyone installs the same exact versions.
